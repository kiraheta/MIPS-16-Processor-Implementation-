# MIPS 16 Processor Implementation 

##Description

The purpose of this project is to showcase the implementation in VERILOG of a MIPS-16 instruction set comprised of the ADD, 
ADDI, NAND, LUI, SW, & LW instructions and the generated output of running sample instructions. These 16 bit binary sample 
instructions are read from a .mips file and stored in the instruction memory unit, or array in this VERILOG implementation.
